<title>The Great Almanac of Gods - The Gods of Neutrality: Glydoc</title> 
<text>The God of Combat and Warfare.
He is the patron saint of all warriors who call out to him for strength in their sword-arms, resilience in their shields, and cunning in their wits. He values honor and justice yet is beset by the battle-lust that rages within. His chosen race, the Orchans, reflect that nature.
A paradoxical god, beset by conflicting natures, he tries to maintain neutrality in all things, not daring to swing too far in one direction or another. In fact, he does his best to avoid entreaties by Aluwen or Mortos to help their cause.
With his recent defeat due to the machinations of Selain and his own initial naivety about the effectiveness of underhanded tactics, Glydoc has been forced to reevaluate his philosophy, and is now seeking to research new methods of warfare. Thus, he is slowly becoming god of not only the honorable general, but also of the traitor and the spy.
He still bears a grudge against Selain for stealing the Orchans out from under him though, so hopes one day to return the favor, in a similar manner.</text>
