      <text>Crystal reflections dance in rings
Murky water's movement sings
The complementing blues of rock
The curving pillar stones

Far below the scented skies
Here, the stony palace resides
With silver walls shining
With sturdy iron ramparts

Though bridges lead to nowhere
Though a million rats make it their lair
The grandeur shall still endure
Beloved caves live on, persist, prevail!
For your treasures will never fade
The shimmering of golden quartz
In the name of Crystal Cave

The sounds of still waters
The shine of precious metals
The fine crafted buildings
Abandoned like a grave
All live on, live on, persist
Under the name of Crystal Cave</text>
