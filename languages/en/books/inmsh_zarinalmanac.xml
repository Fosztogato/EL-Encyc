<title>The Great Almanac of Gods - The Gods of Good: Zarin</title> 
<text>The Goddess of Freedom, Beauty, and the Arts.
Zarin is constantly fascinated by the variety found in nature and the souls of mortals, taking infinite care to nourish it. She is more than willing to become militant abut that, a ruthless side to her which mirrors her fascination with nature itself.
Zarin is the patron of all artists and rewards all those whose ambitions lead to the development of the soul. She wants to make the world a brighter, happier place through artistry. Unfortunately, her methods may be a little too eccentric at times which earn her some rather doubtful looks from her fellow Gods.
But Zarin cheerfully continues on her way, believing that it is only through complete freedom that beauty and spirit can arise.
She hates anything that tries to enslave or dampen the beauty and joy of life and therefore fights an ongoing invisible war with Selain about the social ills that plague the Lands.</text>
