  <title>Substitution codes - Part I</title>
  <text>Always a fascinating subject, but it has become increasingly clear that races on this continent are using the most advanced and creative forms of mathematical and technological knowledge, to create codes and ciphers in their communications.
Whilst this is good for merchants, and does reduce the frequency of bandit raids, I find that it only causes mistrust, and has attracted the attention of many underground agencies throughout Seridia.
Codes have evolved greatly over the years, but have only recently been used as a matter of normality when it comes to communications. My research has found that substitution codes are being used much more frequently than people realize. </text>
