<title>The Great Almanac of Gods - The Gods of Good: Elandria</title> 
<text>The Goddess of Home, Love and Invention.
The patron of lovers and families, she is well-loved for her kind, protective nature, and is the most popular goddess to invoke during marriage ceremonies.
After Dvar had abandoned his Godly duties, Elandria assumed part of his role, in order to protect her children. Thus, she became the patron goddess for the Humans and the Gnomes, both races that are well-known for their inventiveness in overcoming difficult problems.
She hates the destruction visited upon cities and their inhabitants by nature, and hence constantly strives to invent new ways for the races to protect themselves form the chaotic forces in which Centau revels.
She, even more than Aluwen, doesn't want the horrors of impermanence - particularly war - in the world, so continually assists the races in building structures of strength and longevity. However, she can be a bit loose with nature, which causes the over-harvesting of materials for building and provokes Centau.
Of all the deities, Elandria is perhaps most involved in the races' day-to-day life - leading some of her brothers and sisters to accuse her of being a bit too meddlesome at times.</text>
