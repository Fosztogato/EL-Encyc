<title>The Great Almanac of Gods - The Gods of Good: Aluwen</title> 
<text>The Goddess of Life, Goodness and Truth.
She believes strongly in the intrinsic worth of all living things, constantly striving to heal the sick or wounded. She has a tendency to choose diplomacy first and foremost, and violence only as a last resort.
Her race, the Elves, have inherited her love of nature and the sanctity of life.
She also believes that there is an order, a purpose, to all living things and spends much of her time striving to influence that purpose towards the ultimate good. As such, she is constantly at odds with her evil counterpart, Mortos, and fights an unending battle with him to determine the direction of the Lands - Good or Evil.
Originally having enormous sway over the populace, she was briefly able to establish a reign of peace over the Lands during Mortos' banishment, but later had to sacrifice a large portion of her power and influence to mitigate the curse of the undead that had fueled the destruction of the Great War.</text>
