      <text>Flyin' through the air, followin' the smell,
Gotta find me the flower, can't ya tell,
The sweetest nectar, you ever did find,
And now, ya know, it's mine, all mine!

buzzin' along, findin' those flowers!
buzz buzz buzz!
gotta get home, make some honey!
buzz buzz buzz!

All the people, in ma way,
They gonna take my flowers away!
Gotta go protect, ma greatest find!
Gonna go sting them, in the bee-hind!

buzzin' along, findin' those flowers!
buzz buzz buzz!
gotta get home, make some honey!
buzz buzz buzz!

Ma nature don't tell me, who to sting,
I fly around, just doing MY thing!
Flittin around, from lilac to rose,
No time to stop, no time to doze!

buzzin' along, findin' those flowers!
buzz buzz buzz!
gotta get home, make some honey!
buzz buzz buzz!

Gotta get home, back to the hive,
Gotta be quick, that's some drive!
Gotta tell 'em all, what I found,
Gonna be more bees hangin' 'round!

buzzin' along, findin' those flowers!
buzz buzz buzz!
gotta get home, make some honey!
buzz buzz buzz!

No time to stop, no time to stroll,
No time for bee birth control,
An' that's why, in times like these,
There are so many sons of Bees!

buzzin' along, findin' those flowers!
buzz buzz buzz!
gotta get home, make some honey!
buzz buzz buzz!

buzzin' along, findin' those flowers!
buzz buzz buzz!
gotta get home, make some honey!
buzz buzz buzz!</text>
