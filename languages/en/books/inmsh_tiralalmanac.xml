<title>The Great Almanac of Gods - The Shadow Deities: Tiral</title> 
<text>Tiral, the first and oldest of the Dragons, the first race on the planet, was given eternal life by Aluwen to watch over creation. Not as powerful as the Gods, she was grieved when her race was destroyed due to the fog of violence that caused the Dragon Wars to erupt. Redefining her role as protector, she now sits as guardian over the lost continent, waiting and watching for the time where she would be able to reverse the course of history, and send a common man back in time to remove the fog, and prevent the wars from happening.</text>
