<text>Traveler, you've just entered our little maze. Be aware that nothings works here as you could expect.
Some places might be even dangerous. To be honest we don't know this maze although we build it, signed mages of Air.
P.S. to move from one room to another place your palm on door's arches.
Good luck. There is an exit!</text>
