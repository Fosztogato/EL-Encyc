      <text>One day I awoke in a wondrous world
Where magic is real and elves still roam
Seen dwarves and gnomes walking hand and hand
What is the name of this great land

Seen human and orchan and I know dragons were here
They have left their descendants for a Draegoni draws near
I find it hard to believe after all only human here

Just as I thought I had seen it all
I met the fluffy bunny and took a fall
Arrived in the underworld yes I did
When I saw the great dragon skull I immediately hid
After some time I found the exit and it was snowing again

Cold and dark it was time to leave
So I took a boat to white stone city
Or as most call it WSC
There's Gorlic and Frukas who sell books to me
I stop by Raven's storage where a lot of my friends will be

Where to go after WSC
So many great places that needs to be seen
Portland, Desert pines, Morcraven Marsh, and many more
Some of them even I have never seen

There are also secrets scattered here and there
I think I could explore forever here
Growing stronger and wiser with no end in sight
Wandering these Eternal Lands
Both day and night</text>
