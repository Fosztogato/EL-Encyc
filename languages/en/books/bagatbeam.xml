<text>One day I found myself at the beam
Helping new people build their esteem
Telling the same story I always tell
Giving them goodies and wishing them well

This is Isla Prima where it all begins
Snow covered small island
where you'll meet your first friend
You can fight rabbits, rats, beavers, and deer
But when they win the Underworld is near

I have your bag at the beam my friend
Go north go north and click on the arch
This is the way the best friendships start
Once at the beam we must teach you to trade
Welcome to EL; have a great first day

One day later I receive a pm
"I have met the White Stone gargoyle"
"and lost all my things"
"he hit me twice and that was the end"

I have your bag at the beam my friend
Go north go north
I type once again
When you're new and it's night the garg always wins

We trade and talk about each other's plans
Then we part ways to explore the eternal lands
I, to Nordcarn storage, to meet my guild and my friends
You, to go meet Raven, before this day ends

The next day without much surprise
A PM on my screen graces my eyes
"Hello, I'm sorry, I did it again "
"The goblin got me, in a place called Portland"
"I know I know"

You have my bag at the beam my friend
Go north go north
The fun never ends
The next day while fighting troll
I let my health get way too low
So on a trip to the Underworld
I must now go

While I am there a PM graces my screen
"I have your bag friend, let's meet at the beam"
As I arrive I see on my screen
My friend is telling the story
While giving out things


"This is Isla Prima where it all begins
Snow covered small island
where you'll meet your first friend
You can fight rabbits, rats, beavers, and deer
But when they win the Underworld is near

I have your bag at the beam my friend
Go north go north and click on the arch
This is the way the best friendships start
Once at the beam we must teach you to trade
Welcome to EL; have a great first day"</text>
