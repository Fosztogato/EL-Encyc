     <text>At night, as I walk the shores of Riven beach
The beauty strikes me every time
The flowers I'm surrounded by
are just within my reach

I watch the hopping bunnies play
I cant help giggle when I see
How careless they can jump around
It moves me more then I can say

I dance with wolves in the earliest light
Enjoy their joyful company
Stroll the woods of Tirnwood Vale
With those doggies at my side

Oh Eternal lands, what you've given me
Is beyond most every dream
Your lands, they keep me safe
I've never felt so free

You've given me my joy in living
You've given me new meanings
You brought back laughter in my days
And taught the gift of giving

These lands are full of life and love
And with an open mind and heart
There's lots for everyone to learn
With some help from Teh God above

So... like in real life, enjoy your time around
Use every minute you can spend
Because life can end within a second
And you'll end up... Underground..!</text>
