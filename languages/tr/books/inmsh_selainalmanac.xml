<title>The Great Almanac of Gods - The Gods of Evil: Selain</title> 
<text>The God of Wealth, Corruption and Vice.
Selain came from a rough mortal childhood, and perhaps more than any other God understands the realities of a harsh life.
He constantly seeks to better his position and power in any given situation, using any means possible (usually corrupt). He worked his way up the mortal social ladder, and then achieved godhood, aided and abetted by Mortos, which precipitated the War of the Gods.
Although his initial efforts in the War involved only bribery and drug-control, throughout the long centuries, Selain has become a master in his field, surpassing even Mortos in his ability to twist the bodies and souls of mortals to his use. He is the patron of all merchants and criminals and the developer of Summoning and Conjuring. Most of the monsters were invented and given life by Selain.
Upon developing a way to extract the life essences from the very substance of the Lands, he was able to create new and fiendish caricatures of living things to plague Aluwen and Zarin, whom he dismisses as extremely naive Goddesses pursuing ridiculous goals.</text>
