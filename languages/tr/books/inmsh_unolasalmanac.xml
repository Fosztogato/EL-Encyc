<title>The Great Almanac of Gods - The Gods of Neutrality: Unolas</title> 
<text>The god of Magic, Wisdom and Knowledge.
Having attained his godhood through the guidance of Mortos then being forced into war against Aluwen, Zarin, and Glydoc, Unolas now strives to remain aloof and throws himself into the pursuit of knowledge, wisdom and mastery of magic instead.
Even as an Elf, he was acknowledged as the brightest among his race, but as a god, his knowledge soon exceeded all the other deities.
He is the patron of teachers and mages. He often has lively philosophical debates with both Aluwen and Mortos, attempting to ascertain the true natures of Good and Evil, refusing to accept traditional definitions.
Often, Elandria or Glydoc would go to him for a fresh perspective on their own problems, and Unolas enjoys dabbling in invention or research.</text>
