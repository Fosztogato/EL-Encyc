      <text>I'm walking through white stone
On my bare feet
This is the land where so many people meet
I know I'm not alone

What is that smell
It smells like something from a well
This creature in my sight
Is that the thing who roams the night

Suddenly the creature sprung up in the sky
This is hard to believe but this isn't a lie
I grabbed my almighty sword
And attacked
After a fierce battle the thing collapsed

The moon revealed itself from behind the clouds
And the sight opened my mouth
Did I really defeat the gargoyle with only my sword
Has it really gone this fast
It has to be, because I gave the king my word
Now the land is save again and the newbs will last</text>
