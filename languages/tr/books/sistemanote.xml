<text>Dear Reader,
I've left this message here as a memory for everyone to read and 
remember. It was real fun making a map for Eternal Lands. I've enjoyed it so 
much.
I'd like to thank the whole of the EL team, for their hard work to make 
EL a better place. I hope you enjoy my map and my house as much as I 
did making it.
Special greetings go to m'lord Soldus and m'lady Aislinn, my brother 
Hyperion and my dear guild mates of The Eternal Guardians. I couldn't 
have done it without you all!
Just a little note, don't try opening our chest, and don't try stealing 
my swords and shields, they're all gifts from my grandfather, Prince 
Saret, and are important to me. Also, before you leave the house, make 
sure you clean it up, and leave it as it was when you entered.
Well, if you want me, I'm probably in a secret cave somewhere in Dra 
Syn. See you.
SisteMa Silverwish.</text>
