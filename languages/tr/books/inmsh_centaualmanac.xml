<title>The Great Almanac of Gods - The Gods of Evil: Centau</title> 
<text>The God of Change, Chaos and the raw Forces of Nature.
Originally advocating the need for constant change and opposing the efforts of Elandria to find a permanent shelter for the races, he caused his race of Centaurs to live and die by his whim.
The rebellion of his people against him shattered his confidence and Mortos drove him mad with insidious thoughts.
Now he dwells in the depths of the oceans, constantly swaying before his fury, and unleashes his madness against all of the Lands. Beyond the control of any of the other gods, he creates havoc for all those who dare to work with or in the elements, and is especially irritated by Elandria's excessive usage of natural materials to fuel "her hobby", as he calls it.
He still retains enough of his personality to have semi-lucid moments, though, in which he recalls his grudge against Mortos, and affectionately tries to help Zarin in the creation of beautiful things in nature, though he tends towards striking examples of raw power, rather than subtle beauty.</text>
