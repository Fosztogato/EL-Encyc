<title>The Great Almanac of Gods - The Gods of Neutrality: Glilin</title> 
<text>The God of Craftsmanship, Discipline and Skill.
Originally a master craftsman of the Dwarves, he marshaled his race during the War of the Gods and was elevated to Divinity as a result. Although he fought on the side of Good in that battle, Glilin is not primarily predisposed to it, still maintaining Dwarvish practicality and neutrality.
He is the patron of all craftsmen, from jewelers to blacksmiths, who pray to him to grant them skill in their work.
With the wisdom gained from a long life as a mortal, he is a little more inclined to think about the quality and type of people involved, rather than the number.
A merry god who doesn't take his Divinity too seriously, he delights in the invention of new things and often has many discussions with Elandria and Unolas about the properties of different materials and elements.
A strict disciplinarian who believes that hard work is the way to achieve any worthwhile goal in life, he tends to favor those that are willing to follow the system rather than the eccentric geniuses that Zarin prefers.</text>
