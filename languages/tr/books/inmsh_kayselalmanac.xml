<text>First and most powerful of the Dragons, the first race on the planet, she was given eternal life by Aluwen to watch over creation.
Not as powerful as the Gods, she was grieved when her race was destroyed in the Dragon Wars. Redefining her role as protector, she now sits as guardian over the scattered and hidden continents, hoping, waiting, and watching for the time when she will be able to reverse the course of history, to send a common man back in time, and prevent the wars from happening.
Thus, Kaysel began to study the mysteries of Time and Fate, hoping to assuage her grief.</text>
