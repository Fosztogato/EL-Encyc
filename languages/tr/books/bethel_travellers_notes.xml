		My notes about Bethel
		</title>
		<text>
There reads several small notes on the paper:
"- The name Bethel is not the original name of this sandy area where the evil Chimeran Wolves roam and which is called Bethel in most languages. The older name has been forgotten."
"- Was told the name Bethel was first translated from Draegoni language by someone called Lord Vermor."
"- Nobody here in Irilion knew about that Lord Vermor, but someone referred to King Vermor in Seridia. Relations between them?"
"- Heard about a cave in Bethel which is named by the Lord Vermors name, but haven't found that place. Maybe it is hidden?"
"- Must find the Draegoni name for Bethel... Maybe some clues in a Draegoni area?"
