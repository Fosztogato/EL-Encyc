<title>The Great Almanac of Gods - The Shadow Deities: Dvar</title> 
<text>The lost god of Balance, Invention and Craftsmanship.
In the prime of his powers, Dvar was on par with Aluwen and Mortos, and was responsible for maintaining the balance between Good and Evil as they fought over the Lands.
Originally the god of the Dwarves and Gnomes, he was led astray by Mortos into the depths of the earth, seeking out new materials and ways of invention. This has resulted in the loss of a moderating influence on the world, allowing both Good and Evil the possibility of achieving total dominance over the other.
His godly duties of craftsmanship were taken up by Elandria and Glilin, but nevertheless, no one knows what could have happened if Dvar had remained.
His disappearance has led to the skepticism in the Dwarves regarding religion, as they have no God to tell them otherwise, and the Gnomes deserted their cousins, attracted by Elandria's inventive nature.</text>
