      <text>Ha HA ha HEE HEE hoo! Die, die, I cannot die!

No matter what they do to me, I cannot die!

They cut and shock and slash and drown, I cannot die!

They beat and choke and strike and flame, I cannot die!


Girls, girls, lovely girls! They cannot die!

I hunt and catch and bruise and rape, they cannot die!

They fear and run and fall and scream, they cannot die!

I prowl and lick and tear and rip, they cannot die!


Men, men, awful men! They will not die!

They shout and chase and guard the chaste, they will not die!

They judge and lock and jail and starve, they will not die!

But no matter what they do to me, I cannot die!


Ha HA HEE hee HOO! Die, die, I cannot die!

No matter what they do to me, I cannot die!

I cannot die, I CANNOT DIE!</text>
