      <text>Eat. Sleep. Wander.
Sometimes the life of a rabbit is boring.
Eat. Sleep. Wander.
Sometimes the life of a rabbit is repetative.
Eat. Sleep. Wander.
Sometimes the life of a rabbit is easy and carefree
Eat. Sleep. Wander.
But not when you live on Isla Prima!
Run! Duck! Hide!
People out for my fur!
Run away!
People wanting a fight!
Duck and dodge!
People wanting to cook me for dinner!
Hide, and don't come out!
Back to the warren, quick!
Rest.
Be with the other rabbits.
Safety.
Wait! Something is wrong!
Worry.
Oh no! the dark magics of the two-legs brings us back from the dead!
Dread and horror!
Those brought back attack us, and can follow where we hide!
Terror!
Some day, we will see our revenge.
Revenge!
One day the two-legs will meet our fluffy cousin.
Anticipation and glee.</text>
