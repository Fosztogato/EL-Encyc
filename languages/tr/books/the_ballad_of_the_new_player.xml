Starting Isla Prima, day one, EL night.
You're a happy little newbie slaying bunnies left and right.

Here's a NH come to chat with you; he guides you to the boat.
You kill your first beaver in W.S. and spend some time to gloat.

Not even level seven, so you're right back at the beam,
Those Vermor Castle monsters are the meanest things you've seen.

Now get up! You're table hunting; travel quick from town to town.
There are five tavern-bars to visit, the gargoyles can't pin you down.

Starting to gain skills now, at least at chopping flowers.
Sitting there in VotD, lilacs tremble at your powers.

Where will you go from here?
Fighters go on to their very first deer.
Manu freaks sew scarves for hours
Alchemists are crushing flowers.
Mages do good deeds at Beam,
Where scavenging Summoners are often seen.
Crafters haunt the libraries
And Potion Mixers wield their tools with ease.

Your storage list grows long, grows tall.
and finding a chat gives you no trouble at all.

Hourly harvests help you grow stronger
The required exp only gets longer and longer.

Then you reach a level twenty skill, and that tag besides your name,
Says "Hey! I'm not just some newbie!". God I love this game.</text>
