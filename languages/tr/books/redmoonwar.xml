The red moon lights the sky
Trembling earth's warning unheeded
Till the shrill of a sleeper's cry
o AWAKENED! o

What tragic call to arms
Gargoyles swarmed from Vermor Castle
Luxin's soldiers shouted alarms

Goblins too; all darkness' host
Oger's midst the titanium mine
The demons of Tahraji's savage coast

Portland threatened, then overrun!
Till brave warriors make their stand
And when we thought all had been won...

Cave Trolls strike the crystal cave!
The slaughter of miners, innocents all
Made many a mournful grave

The warriors of the dwarven valley
Three invasions did repel
And then....
Mortos' grand finale!

Kilaran Fields became a Hell
Of Chimeran Wolves all running free
Blood and fangs of darkness' spell

Do not forget the fighters, brave or coward
Do not forget the innocents who fell
Do not forget the victims, devoured
Do not forget, though all is well

Though all the monsters are as before
And the sky is beautiful clear
Yet be on guard
For darkness favors war
And Mortos still holds influence here
